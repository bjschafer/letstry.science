I've long struggled with finding an organizational, note taking, and task management system that works for me. I feel like I've tried dang near everything out there, but nothing really "sticks".

Broadly, I divide systems into 4 different categories:

1. ToDo lists
2. Notetaking
3. Semiconverged
4. Fully converged

## ToDo lists

These apps and systems are generally focused on tracking tasks and only tasks. They may support adding notes to tasks but this is not their primary focus.

Examples include:

* Microsoft Todo
* Todoist
* Remember the Milk
* Outlook tasks
* GTD
* Taskwarrior

## Notetaking

In contrast to ToDo lists, notetaking apps and systems provide means to journal or take notes but don't provide any special todo functionality (or extremely rudimentary functionality).

Examples include:

* OneNote
* Evernote
* Roam/Obsidian/Foam
* Text files
* Journaling/note taking on paper

## Semiconverged

Semiconverged systems provide _some_ integration between note taking and task management, but it's limited in some way.

Examples include:

* Bullet Journaling

## Fully converged

What I would refer to as "the holy grail" of organizational systems, fully converged systems provide a means to take notes and todos in a unified fashion.

* Org mode
* Vimwiki + Taskwiki

Eevee (b. 2016) (Evilyn Gregory James, Eve, Ebeb/Eeb Eeb, Pigeon) is a tiger-striped tabby cat who adores people and despises other animals.
She also loves supervising printer work, snatching loose filament to gnaw on, being up high, and making pigeon noises.

Eevee is a bonus cat, she belongs to our housemate.

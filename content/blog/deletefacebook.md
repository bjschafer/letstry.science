I will be deleting my Facebook account on Sunday, 4/29. I don't want to preach about it, though. I think it's important that we consider the facts and make our own choices.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, and it's not a decision I take lightly. I've been on Facebook for nearly a decade, and it's been a great way to keep in touch with friends new and old. I've made, rekindled, and lost friendships along the way.

I've always been aware of Facebook's lax policies on data sharing...however, it's sort of just buzzed around in the back of my mind. With the whole "#deletefacebook" movement coming into the zeitgeist, I took some time to consider it. There's an adage I've frequently heard - "if you're not paying for the product, you *are* the product" - or something along those lines. While it's an easy trap to fall into these days (and one I'm certainly not rid of), I've been trying to slowly pull my way out of it. I've been largely moving away from Gmail onto an email platform (Fastmail) that I pay for. I've been looking for open-source alternatives to social networking ([diaspora\*](https://diasp.org/people/de34afd015ad0136015f047d7b62795e)). I've tried to move to better messaging options (such as Signal and Telegram).

This is not the end of the road, but rather the beginning of a whole new one. I'm glad you're coming along for the ride.

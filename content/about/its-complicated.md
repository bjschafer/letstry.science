I wanted to make a page I can quickly share to help explain what I have that affects what I can eat and do.
Something that I can share for those who want a bit more detail than the standard "well, it's complicated".

Why? In part to let others suffering from similar things know that they're not alone.

# What I have

## Officially

According to my medical record, I have:

- IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome)
- GERD (acid reflux)
- Anxiety

## In a bit more depth

IBS is a functional digestive issue, which basically means that a doctor (or in my case, many doctors) have looked at
everything I have going on and went, "welp, something's not right here, but we don't know what caused it or how to fix it."

This manifests in a variety of ways, including:

- frequent, urgent trips to the bathroom
- or on the flip side, *very* infrequent trips to the bathroom
- food sensitivities, both long-term and short-term:
    - onions, for example, are always a no-go.
    - garlic, for example, can sometimes be a trigger
    - other things may or may not be troublesome.
    - oftentimes, I don't know what it is.
- frequent heartburn
- frequent bad gas
- random gastric pain
- random bouts of nausea

The acid reflux is a somewhat-understood but probably-related portion of IBS.

But why mention the anxiety? Well, there's a good bit of interplay between what's going on in my mind and what's going on in my
gut. So being in a stressful or high-anxiety situation can prime me to have a bad gut day when I otherwise might be okay eating
a given thing.

# What this means for you

If you work with me, hang out with me, or otherwise have to be around me, you may have to deal with some or all of the following:

- frequent and/or long trips to the bathroom. I'll be okay, I'll text you if I need something, but some peace and privacy is appreciated.
- arriving late. This is because of the above.
- leaving early and/or suddenly. Sometimes if I get hit hard, I'm just going to be best off heading out. I promise I still like you and enjoyed spending time with you.
- cancelling plans last minute, see above.
- bad gas. I'm sorry, but it only can go one way, and it's painful.
- dietary restrictions. Since *I* don't always know what's going to trigger my symptoms, I can't just tell you "here's what I can/can't have". The best things you can do are:
    - share a menu with me ahead of time. This lets me plan what I can eat.
    - don't judge what I do or don't eat. Sometimes I get something, start eating it, and realize that it was a poor idea.
    - don't be offended if I bring my own food or decline to eat with you. Eating is a high-stress activity and sometimes I need to do what's going to be most comfortable to me.

# Have you tried...?

I've sought treatment for all three of my "official" diagnoses. I'm on a variety of different meds, many of which treat the symptoms of IBS. However, since they're not going after
the root cause, they don't solve all of the problems, and often have to be taken in a reactionary method (i.e. as symptoms appear).

I'm currently jumping through hoops to get insurance to cover meeting with a health psychologist. This particular practitioner specializes in disorders of the gut-brain axis, which
both my gastroenterologist and I think would be good to help in breaking that feedback loop.

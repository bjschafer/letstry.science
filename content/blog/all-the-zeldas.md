Last week, I completed a longtime personal goal. I can now say I've beaten all the mainline Zelda games!

How do I define "mainline Zelda"? More or less, anything in the _Hyrule Historia_, plus BotW which wasn't released when the book came out. This doesn't include the CD-i games, nor any of the spinoff games such as Hyrule Warriors or Link's Crossbow Training. It also doesn't include the games that require you to have friends to play...

How do I define "beaten"? I played through the entire main story, no hacks, cheats, anything, and beat the boss. Not necessarily 100%, but in several cases, yes.

I wanted to sit down and write about the games a little bit.

## Zelda 1

I think this was the first Zelda game I ever played. My dad had an NES and the classic gold cartridge of Zelda 1. I have ...fond? memories of stumbling around Hyrule and dying a lot.

I ended up revisiting the game on Switch Online and played through it to completion. I 100% this one. Overall, I enjoyed playing it, although the controls felt real clunky.

## Zelda 2: AoL

The black sheep of the Zelda family. Played it early on and had no clue what was going on. Revisited on Switch Online, and played through with lots of help from rewind functionality. As a Zelda game, not good. As an old-school action RPG...just go play a Final Fantasy game.

## LttP

Another game that I played relatively early on (I had the remake for GBA), but I only beat it with the advent of Switch Online. Since that point, though, I've played through it probably 3 or 4 times vanilla, and twice that many randomizer runs. It's just such a neat world and concept. It definitely set trends for future Zelda games to come.

If I had to pick one complaint, it's the controls. The sword never *quite* does what I want it to, and the shield's hitbox is wonky at the best of times.

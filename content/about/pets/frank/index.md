Frank (b. Halloween 2015) (Franklin Anderson Floofington, FinkFink, Finkelgruber) is a grey tabby cat
with a grumpy looking face (we call it Resting Frank Face).
He's a real sweetie who's scared of everything and has had to learn how to cat. He enjoys playing by himself while
meowing loudly, trying to bathe the other cats (who apart from Salem don't tolerate it), and cuddles.

Frank is a bonus cat, he belongs to our housemate.
